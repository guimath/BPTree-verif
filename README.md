# BPTree-verif
B+ Tree data structure formal verification using [dafny](https://dafny.org/)

Project led by Ivona Martinovic (@im50603) & Guilhem Mathieux (@guimath) for the CS6271 - Advanced topics in software engineering class taught by [Ilya Sergey](https://ilyasergey.net/) at NUS.

## Installation 

To run the code you need Dafny installed (see [installation](https://dafny.org/dafny/Installation)). We recommend using the integrated VSCode extension.

Parts of the code are quite long to verify so you might need to either check them separately or augment the Dafny time out (Settings > Dafny: Verification Time Limit)

For more information about the project (goal, results, limitation) see the [final report](final_report.pdf).
